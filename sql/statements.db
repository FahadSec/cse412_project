Other recent public controversies have demanded reevaluations of board vetting procedures to avoid reputational controversies, a more thorough review of corporate sponsors vis-a-vis a museum's mission, and the development of action plans to address the legacy of colonial theft and Nazi looting. Covid-19 has also greatly affected museums--attendance, annual budgets--and has resulted in mass layoffs and organizational restructurings, as museums are left to wonder about their financial viability moving forward. Also discusses whether museums have a moral responsibility to respond to and become engaged with compelling social justice issues like race, immigration, health care, climate change--or whether they should remain neutral. Indeed, the question of museums and social justice has plagued the museum world's preeminent professional organization, the International Council of Museums (ICOM), which, since 2017, has been attempting to redefine the museum as a site for public discourse on urgent topics; amidst debate and turmoil, a possible redefinition of museums of the 21st century as sites for social justice.

Strategic design is closely related to contemporary and emergent design practices such as user experience design, design thinking, service design, speculative design, behavioral design, and co-design, which are increasingly explored, adopted and adapted in projects and organizations. Students understand and practice a variety of strategic design methods and mindsets with the aim of changing and envisioning futures. With hands-on activities and real-world context, students use and develop core strategic design skills such as visualization, sensemaking, synthesis, speculation and facilitation. Some design tools that may be used include storyboards, user flows, journey mapping, participatory ideation, visioning, service blueprints, prototyping-testing. Includes seminar discussions and hands-on activities with a 'live project.'');

With the Earth, examines past events and current natural processes to understand how this past and these processes affect humans. Accordingly, examines the history of the Earth and solar system in the context of the processes, materials and features that can be observed and inferred.
